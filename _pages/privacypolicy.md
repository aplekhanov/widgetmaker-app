# Privacy Policy & Terms
I take your privacy very seriously. I neither want nor need to know anything about your personal data. To that end I’ve designed the app from the ground up to ensure that your data stays completely private.

Custom Widgets Maker can optionally access some of your personal data for display within the app. This includes your photos. All of this access is handled using the standard iOS privacy prompts. If you give the app access to this data it will be read and displayed only within the app.

I don’t want the responsibility of managing your data correctly, so I don’t collect it, which I think is better for both of us.

*Now for the legal boilerplate part of the Privacy Policy.*

## Personally-Identifying Information

The app does not gather or transmit any Personally-Identifying Information outside of your local device. It only stores preferences about the user interface within its local database.

## Business Transfers

If Custom Widgets Maker, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that app goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, this policy and its effects may change or be amended. (As the app does not collect any information about you there is very little effect this would likely have in practice.)

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, the app may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at the app’s sole discretion. Your continued use of this app after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

## Indemnity

You hereby indemnify us and undertake to keep us indemnified against any losses, damages, costs, liabilities and expenses (including, without limitation, legal expenses and any amounts paid by us to a third party in settlement of a claim or dispute on the advice of our legal advisers) incurred or suffered by us arising out of use of this app or any breach by you of any provision of these terms of use, or arising out of any claim that you have breached any provision of these terms of use.

Your continued use of the app will be regarded as acceptance of our practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about it, feel free to contact me by mail@aplekhanov.com

This policy is effective as of 17 February 2021.
